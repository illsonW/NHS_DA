# NHS Data Analysis Project

**Background**

The NHS (National Health Service) seeks to optimize resource allocation amid conflicting views on capacity. To inform recommendations accordingly, I will analyse internal and external data, including Twitter, focusing on capacity usage, and missed appointments. The goal of this data analytic project is to identify trends, extract insights, and suggest data-driven potential solutions to improve NHS systemâ€™s efficiency.

**There are 2 initial questions:**

1.	Has there been adequate staff and capacity in the networks?
2.	What was the actual utilisation of resources?

Further questions will be asked during the data analysis process.

T**hese questions serve to help the NHS reach 2 goals:**

1.	Decide if the NHS should put more resources in hiring more staff.
2.	Reducing or eliminating missed appointments, which incur significant financial costs.

Python will be used for analysis and visualization.
